# ANZ_virtual_experience_program
Background: 

This task is based on a synthesised transaction dataset containing 3 months’ worth of transactions for 100 hypothetical customers. It contains purchases, recurring transactions, and salary transactions.

The dataset is designed to simulate realistic transaction behaviours that are observed in ANZ’s real transaction data, so many of the insights you can gather from the tasks below will be genuine.

## Task 1

## Task 2
__Predictive Analytics__

Exploratory correlations between annual salary and various customer attributes. Build a simple regression model to predict the annual salary for each customer using the attributes you identified above
